## About Me

Welcome to my website. My name is <strong>Yanbing Dai</strong> (<strong>代晏冰</strong>).

I'm currently a second-year Master's student in Power Engineering at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) (<b>XJTU</b>), advised by Assoc. Prof. [Xiaoqu Han](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaoqu-Han) (韩小渠). Prior to this, I obtained my B.E. in Power Engineering at <b>XJTU</b> in 2021.

My focus is on XXXXX. The recent advancements in XXXX have strengthened my belief in its potential applications in engineering. I’m excited to be part of this rapidly evolving field.
