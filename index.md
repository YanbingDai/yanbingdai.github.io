## About Me

Welcome to my website. My name is <strong>Yanbing Dai</strong> (<strong>代晏冰</strong>).

I'm currently a second-year Master's student in Power Engineering at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) (<b>XJTU</b>), advised by Assoc. Prof. [Xiaoqu Han](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/hanxiaoqu/home) (韩小渠). Prior to this, I obtained my B.E. in Power Engineering at <b>XJTU</b> in 2021.

My research focuses on developing highly-efficient energy conversion systems and analyzing their energetic, exergetic, economic, and environmental performance. These investigations are vital for resolving today’s global energy crisis and achieving climate change mitigation objectives. I am excited to contribute to this rapidly evolving field.
